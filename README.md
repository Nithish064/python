Project Title : Information Retrival System
LLM Model : Google Palm Model
Google PaLM Model : 
	Google's PaLM (Pathways Language Model) is a highly advanced language model designed for superior natural language understanding and generation.
Language : Python, Streamlit
Description : 
		This system leverages advanced natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to enable users to interact with documents in a more intuitive way. Users can upload a PDF file, and the AI will analyze the content, allowing them to ask questions about the document. The AI then processes the question, retrieves relevant information from the PDF, and provides a concise and accurate answer.



Features : 
•	Pdf Upload : Users can easily upload PDF files through a user-friendly interface
•	Content Analysis: The AI system parses the PDF, extracting text, tables, and other relevant data.
•	Question Understanding: Users can ask questions in natural language
•	Information Retrieval: The system scans the entire document to find the most relevant sections that answer the user's question.
•	Concise Responses: The AI generates clear and concise answers, drawing directly from the content of the PDF.
•	Multi-Document Support: Users can upload multiple PDFs, with the AI capable of cross-referencing information across documents to provide comprehensive answers.
